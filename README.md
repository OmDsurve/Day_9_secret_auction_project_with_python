# Day_9_secret_auction_project_with_python
This Python project is a bidding program that identifies the highest bidder. Users enter names and bids, stored in a dictionary. The program checks if there are more bidders, and once all bids are in, it announces the winner. It uses loops, conditionals, and a function to manage input and determine the highest bid.
